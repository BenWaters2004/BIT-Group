# BIT-Group

Previosly all BIT-Group websites were created using WordPress. I am now coding them to provide us with more control and to allow for more customisation. There have been several occurences where something we wanted to do was not really possible within WordPress, or theres been an issue which we have to wait for WordPress to fix.

Languages/Markup Languages used:
- PHP
